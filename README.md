# GeminiQuest-AI-Powered-Contextual-Insights
Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1


## **Introduction**

This project aims to showcase the power of **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** in creating an intelligent, context-aware chatbot capable of answering queries from a specific corpus of text. By leveraging **semantic search** and **text embeddings**, the chatbot is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and natural language responses to user queries, transforming the way information is retrieved and processed.

The underlying use case involves processing a large dataset (such as *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*) and building a knowledge base that can be dynamically queried. Through **Google’s embedding model**, the text is transformed into high-dimensional vectors optimized for document retrieval tasks. By utilizing **Google Gemini's** capabilities, this system can understand, interpret, and generate human-like responses to complex queries, offering a highly interactive and intuitive AI solution.

This project highlights the integration of AI technologies to enable efficient, scalable, and intelligent information retrieval. With **Generative AI capabilities** at the core, the project demonstrates a seamless approach to building smarter systems for contextual information processing, which has wide applications in industries ranging from **customer support** to **education** and **content management**.


### **Gen AI Capabilities Demonstrated in the Capstone Project**

This project leverages several advanced capabilities of **Google Generative AI** (Gemini), ensuring that the system is not only highly efficient but also capable of producing intelligent and contextually aware responses. Below are the three key capabilities demonstrated in the project:

1. **Embeddings**:  
   **Text Embeddings** are generated using Google's **Generative AI** to convert the content (such as *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*) into high-dimensional vectors. This allows for semantic search, enabling the system to retrieve relevant information based on the meaning rather than just keywords. The embeddings are crucial in ensuring that the responses are contextually appropriate and aligned with the user's query.

2. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**:  
   The system integrates **retrieval augmented generation** by combining **document retrieval** with generative capabilities. The relevant context from the document is retrieved using **semantic search** and then augmented with the generative abilities of Google Gemini to create more accurate and context-aware responses. This hybrid approach enhances the system's ability to provide more reliable and relevant information.

3. **Document Understanding**:  
   The project incorporates **document understanding** by processing large text corpora and enabling the chatbot to answer questions based on the content. The system uses the **Gemini model** to comprehend and analyze documents, extracting key information and transforming it into usable knowledge that can be queried by users. This understanding is essential for providing coherent, accurate answers to complex questions.

4. **Gen AI Evaluation**:   
Gen AI evaluation techniques are employed to assess the effectiveness of the generated responses in meeting predefined quality criteria such as relevance, accuracy, coherence, fluency, and conciseness. The evaluation process includes pointwise analysis of individual question-answer pairs to ensure that the responses not only align with user expectations but also provide meaningful and contextually relevant information. Specific evaluation methods include:

- **Relevance**: Ensuring that the response appropriately addresses the query.
- **Accuracy**: Verifying that the information provided is correct.
- **Coherence**: Checking if the answer is logically structured and easy to understand.
- **Fluency**: Assessing whether the language is natural and error-free.
- **Conciseness**: Ensuring the response is clear and to the point.
- **Quality**: Determining whether the answer provides valuable insights based on the query.


By combining these capabilities, the project demonstrates an intelligent approach to content processing, retrieval, and generation, paving the way for more sophisticated AI applications in real-world scenarios.
